Limitations of the Study: 
-	Warehouse Locations, maintenance fees, etc. are unknown. It is assumed that warehouses are near to each other.  
-	Logistics were not considered.  
-	Sample Size Inefficiency. Sales are only available from 2003 to 2 quarters of 2005.
Applications used are SQL (for queries), Excel (for visualization), and Word (to indicate observations, show charts, and show recommendations).

Observations:
1.	Very High and Low Inventories but Low and High Demand respectively. 
o	There are several products with very high inventory levels but low demand, resulting in large amounts of unsold stock. This scenario is particularly evident in warehouses A, B, C, and D across various product lines such as Motorcycles, Classic Cars, Vintage Cars, and Ships.
o	Some products have high demand but insufficient inventory, leading to negative remaining stock values. This issue is seen in all warehouses and various product lines.
2.	Classic Cars (Warehouse B):
o	Classic Cars are the most in-demand product based on the sum of ordered units.
o	Despite high demand, Classic Cars have the highest number of unsold units.
o	The demand growth rate for Classic Cars is relatively low compared to other products.
3.	Other Warehouses:
o	Warehouse A (Motorcycles and Planes) and Warehouse C (Vintage Cars) also show significant sales but with better demand growth rates.
o	Warehouse D (Trucks, Buses, Trains, and Ships) has moderate sales and high unsold units.
Analysis Based on Key Questions:
1.	Where are items stored, and if rearranged, could a warehouse be eliminated?
o	Items are currently stored based on product types in four different warehouses.
o	Given the high storage capacity of Warehouse B (219,000 units), it is feasible to reorganize and consolidate products from Warehouse D into Warehouses A and C.
2.	How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Do the inventory counts seem appropriate for each item?
3.	Are we storing items that are not moving? Are any items candidates for being dropped from the product line?
o	Despite being popular, Classic Cars have many unsold units, indicating overproduction or potential issues with product appeal or marketing.
o	Trucks, Buses, Trains, and Ships in Warehouse D also have high number of unsold units, suggesting a need for review.
o	The chart below is a box and whisker plot. The rectangle represents the interquartile range (IQR) showing the middle 50% of the data, with the line inside indicating the median quantity ordered. The whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the IQR. The dots represent outliers, which are unusually high or low quantities ordered. 
This doesn’t indicate that we should drop the dots from the product line. The company can optimize inventory levels that will meet the demand and supply.
Recommendations: 
1.	Optimize Inventory Levels. 
-	Align the production of the products, particularly the Classic Cars Product with the actual sales demand. 
-	Monitor all the inventory levels and adjust production rates to prevent overstocking.
-	Consider reducing the production or procurement of these products to align inventory levels with demand. Implement targeted marketing strategies to boost sales or consider phasing out products with consistently low demand.
-	Increase production or procurement for these high-demand products to meet customer demand and avoid stockouts. Improve inventory management to ensure a balanced supply that meets the market demand.
2.	Consolidate Warehouse D. 
-	Assume that warehouses are near to each other, logistics is not an issue, and warehouses can accommodate 219,000 units (based on Warehouse B).
- 	 Reorganize and place the products from Warehouse D to Warehouses A and C respectively, effectively removing Warehouse D. 
▪	Motorcycles and Planes (Warehouse A) can take on additional inventory from Trucks and Buses.	
- Vintage Cars (Warehouse C) can absorb inventory from Trains and Ships.
